  The honest gap map.

  This file states the faithfulness condition needed for Cook encoding
  to preserve obstruction structure. CookFaithful is the OPEN BRIDGE
  CONDITION: it is stated as a structure, not proved, not assumed as
  an axiom. Any result depending on it takes it as an explicit parameter.

  The question: does Cook encoding preserve obstruction depth up to
  polynomial distortion? This file is brutally explicit about what
  is known, what is open, and what each direction would give.

/-! # Cook Faithfulness

Cook's theorem encodes arbitrary NP instances into SAT instances.
The encoding is polynomial-time computable. But does it preserve
the *obstruction structure* — the depth/dimension of why instances
are hard — up to polynomial distortion?

This is the open bridge condition. Everything here is either:
1. A definition (no proof obligation), or
2. A simple lemma about the definitions (fully proved).

Nothing is assumed. Nothing is sorry'd. -/

    - model_depth: the obstruction depth in the encoded/algebraic model

    The key question is whether these two depths are polynomially related. -/

-- Section 4: The Open Bridge Condition
-- ============================================================

/-- **CookFaithful**: The central open condition.

    Given a Cook encoding, faithfulness means the obstruction depths
    on the two sides (SAT topology vs encoded model) are polynomially
    related — neither side can hide obstructions that the other misses
    by more than a polynomial factor.

    This is a STRUCTURE, not a theorem. It is the explicit hypothesis
    that downstream results carry as a parameter.

    - h_lower: model depth, scaled up polynomially, dominates SAT depth.
      "The encoding doesn't destroy obstructions."
    - h_upper: model depth is bounded by SAT depth scaled polynomially.
      "The encoding doesn't create fake obstructions." -/

  /-- The obstruction profile witnessing faithfulness -/
  profile : ObstructionProfile
  /-- Lower bound: encoding preserves obstructions (up to polynomial) -/
