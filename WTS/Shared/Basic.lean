/-! # Instance Families

An instance family is a size-indexed collection of instances,
witnesses, and a decidable satisfaction predicate.

This is the combinatorial core of NP:
for each size n, there are instances φ and witnesses w,
and checking Sat n φ w is decidable and efficient. -/

/-- A family of decision problems indexed by input size. -/
structure InstanceFamily where
  /-- Instance type at size n -/
  X : Nat → Type
  /-- Witness type at size n -/
  W : Nat → Type
  /-- Satisfaction predicate: does witness w satisfy instance φ at size n? -/
  Sat : (n : Nat) → X n → W n → Prop
  /-- Satisfaction is decidable (this IS verification — the eq3 side) -/
  h_dec : ∀ n (x : X n) (w : W n), Decidable (Sat n x w)
  /-- Instances are finite at each size -/
  h_fin_X : ∀ n, Fintype (X n)
  /-- Witnesses are finite at each size -/
  h_fin_W : ∀ n, Fintype (W n)
