  SAT instances, assignments, local/global sections, and gluing.

  This file defines the combinatorial structure of SAT: variables,
  clauses, assignments, and the local-to-global passage from
  clause-level satisfiability to full satisfiability.

/-! # SAT Presheaf Core

The presheaf perspective on SAT: each clause defines a "local site"
(its variables), a local section is a partial assignment satisfying
that clause, and a global section is a total assignment satisfying
all clauses. The gluing question — whether compatible local sections
extend to a global section — is exactly the satisfiability question. -/

namespace WTS

/-- A SAT instance: a number of variables and a list of clauses.
    Each clause is a list of signed integers: positive means the
    variable appears positive, negative means negated. Variables
    are 1-indexed in the literal encoding: literal `k` means
    variable `k-1`, literal `-k` means `¬(variable k-1)`. -/
structure SATInstance where
  num_vars : Nat
  clauses : List (List Int)

namespace SATInstance

/-- A total assignment of Boolean values to variables. -/
def Assignment (φ : SATInstance) : Type :=
  Fin φ.num_vars → Bool

/-- Whether a single literal is satisfied by an assignment.
    Literal `k` (k > 0) is satisfied when variable `k-1` is true.
    Literal `-k` (k > 0) is satisfied when variable `k-1` is false.
    Literal `0` is never satisfied.
    Out-of-range literals are vacuously not satisfied. -/
def literalSatisfied (φ : SATInstance) (a : φ.Assignment) (lit : Int) : Bool :=

      if lit > 0 then a ⟨idx, hlt⟩

/-! ## Local and Global Sections -/

/-- A local section for clause index `i`: a total assignment that
    satisfies that particular clause. We use a total assignment
    rather than a partial one to keep proofs simple — the "locality"
    is in which clause it certifies, not in the domain of the function. -/
structure LocalSection (φ : SATInstance) (i : Fin φ.clauses.length) where
  assignment : φ.Assignment
  satisfies : φ.clauseSatisfied assignment (φ.clauses.get i) = true

/-- A global section: a total assignment satisfying all clauses. -/
structure GlobalSection (φ : SATInstance) where
  assignment : φ.Assignment
  satisfies : φ.instanceSatisfied assignment = true

def LocalSection.compatible (φ : SATInstance) (i j : Fin φ.clauses.length)
    (si : LocalSection φ i) (sj : LocalSection φ j) : Prop :=
  si.assignment = sj.assignment

/-- The gluing problem: whether there exist pairwise compatible
    local sections covering all clauses. Since our local sections
    use total assignments, compatibility means they all use the
    same assignment. -/

  ∃ (sections : ∀ i : Fin φ.clauses.length, LocalSection φ i),
    ∀ i j, (sections i).assignment = (sections j).assignment
