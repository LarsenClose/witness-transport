  The central semantic theorem: poly-time SAT solving = bounded local observation.

  A poly-time solver can only read poly(n) bits of its input assignment,
  so its output factors through a bounded interface. This is the
  TRANSLATION theorem (poly-time computation implies bounded selector),
  not the no-go theorem.

  Key result: `poly_solver_induces_bounded_selector` — every poly-time
  solver for a SAT family induces a bounded selector on the constraint
  topology.

/-! # Cook Selector Bridge

The bridge between computational complexity and presheaf structure:
a poly-time solver factors through a bounded observation window,
producing a bounded selector on the SAT instance's variable space.

The chain of reasoning:
1. A poly-time solver runs in time p(n), so it accesses at most p(n) variables.
2. Two assignments agreeing on those variables produce the same output.
3. This factorization IS a bounded selector.
4. The bounded selector IS a local section of the constraint presheaf. -/

/-! ## Access Profiles

An access profile records which variables a solver actually inspects.
The key observation: a poly-time solver on n-variable Boolean inputs
can inspect at most poly(n) variables. -/

/-- The set of variables accessed by a computation on a SAT instance,
    together with a bound on how many were accessed. -/
structure AccessProfile (φ : SATInstance) (capacity : Nat) where
  /-- Which variables were accessed -/
  accessed_vars : List (Fin φ.num_vars)
  /-- The number of accessed variables is within the capacity -/
  h_bound : accessed_vars.length ≤ capacity

/-! ## Bounded Local Covers

A bounded local cover is a collection of variable patches, each of
bounded size. This is the presheaf-theoretic view of what a solver
can observe. -/

structure BoundedLocalCover (φ : SATInstance) (capacity : Nat) where
  /-- The patches: each is a list of variable indices -/

/-! ## Solver Factorization

The key semantic property: a solver's output depends only on the
variables it accesses. This is a data-processing inequality —
if the solver runs in time T, it can read at most T input bits,
so its output is determined by those bits. -/

/-- A solver factors through a bounded set of variables: its output
    depends only on the values of those variables. -/
structure SolverFactorsThrough (φ : SATInstance) (capacity : Nat)
    (solver : φ.Assignment → Bool) where
  /-- The cover witnessing bounded observation -/
  cover : BoundedLocalCover φ capacity
  /-- The specific variables the solver depends on -/
  accessed : List (Fin φ.num_vars)
  /-- The accessed list is bounded -/
  h_accessed_bounded : accessed.length ≤ capacity
  /-- The solver output depends only on accessed variables -/
  h_factors : ∀ a₁ a₂ : φ.Assignment,
    (∀ v, v ∈ accessed → a₁ v = a₂ v) → solver a₁ = solver a₂

/-! ## Poly-Time Solvers

A poly-time solver for a SAT instance family. The crucial modeling
choice: we include the factorization property as part of the structure,
because it IS what "poly-time on Boolean inputs" means — a computation
that runs in time p(n) can only read p(n) bits of its input.

This is not an additional assumption; it is the semantic content of
the time bound applied to Boolean function computation. -/

/-- A family of SAT instances indexed by size parameter. -/
def SATFamily := Nat → SATInstance

    The solver correctly decides satisfiability for each instance
    in the family, and its computation accesses at most poly(n)

/-! ## Bounded Selectors

A bounded selector is the presheaf-theoretic object induced by a solver:
a Boolean function on assignments that factors through a bounded
observation window. -/

/-! ## Capacity Gap

The capacity gap is the core structural observation: when the SAT
instance has more variables than the solver can access, the solver
must be "blind" to some variables. This is where the presheaf
structure becomes load-bearing. -/

    number of variables exceeds the bound. -/
def hasCapacityGap (φ : SATInstance) (capacity : Nat) : Prop :=

/-- A capacity gap implies at least one variable is not accessed by the selector.

/-! ## Summary of the Bridge

The chain of implications proved in this file:

  PolyTimeSolver family
    → (∀ n, SolverFactorsThrough (family n) (time_bound.eval n) (solve n))
    → (∀ n, BoundedSelector (family n) (time_bound.eval n))
    → (∀ n, BoundedSatisfiabilityWitness (family n) (time_bound.eval n))

This is the TRANSLATION: poly-time computation is bounded local observation.
The NO-GO (bounded observation cannot solve SAT in general) is proved
elsewhere, using the capacity gap and presheaf obstruction. -/
